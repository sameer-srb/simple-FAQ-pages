### What I learned 📑
While working on this project, I learned:
- How to structure semantic **FAQ sections** using `<section>`, `<h2>`, `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<a>` tags.
- Applying **responsive design** with media queries (`@media` for tablets and mobiles).
- Styling **lists, links, and dividers** for better readability.
- Importance of **container max-width** for cleaner layouts.
